# What is the probability that a triangle, sampled by three uniformly distributed points on a circle, contains the center of the circle?

There is an exect solution which can be obtained with some mathematical considerations.
Instead we decided to implement a small script that approximates the probability.

# TODO
Generalize to the n-dimensional case.
